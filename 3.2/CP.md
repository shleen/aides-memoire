# Week 1
School's back! This semester, three of us (Nicholas, Robin, & I) are taking Capstone Project on, with the grand, grand ambitions of being able to produce something worthy of awe-inspiring gazes.

To do that, we're going to need to ensure that we remain clearheaded & focused on The Goal throughout the semester & let as little time pass us by as possible. This page will serve as the residing location for documentation regarding CP. Do take note that notes are separated, at the highest level, by weeks.

Going into Week 1 of the semester, we have yet to decide on the idea we will be working on. When we applied for CP last semester, we had wanted to continue work on EatNow, our P2 project. However, we were told that there were a surplus of projects for this semester, & that we wouldn't be able to propose our own projects. Simultaneously, we were receiving word from other sources that it may be possible for us to self-propose an idea for CP. It was in this way that we ended up registering for CP anyways & essentially giving our fates to a higher order. 

Luckily, we soon received news that Dr Oon (the project supervisor for our chosen CP) was interested in taking us on for Capstone, & that he was open to hearing our idea for bringing EatNow further. We were, understandably, delighted to hear this. However, after some deliberation, we found that we'd essentially brought EatNow as far as feasible for a school project. We were at a loss for what the next steps for EatNow should look like. Nevertheless, we remained hopeful that we would be able to take EatNow to yet greater heights during CP. We resolved, then, to putting our brains together to see what, if anything, we'd like to pursue with EatNow, while remaining open to adopting the original CP idea - revamping the Who Knows quizzing system. 

The following are the notes we've consolidated in preparation of our first CP meeting, on 14/10/2019.

## Things to Get Straight
- What's the objective of CP? Technical complexity only or the final product we can produce?
- Is it a valid goal to look into the business prospect of it?

## Agenda
- What is EatNow?
- What is CP? 
- If we were to do EatNow, our ideas.

## What CP would look like, if we did EatNow?
- Get validation of EatNow.
- Get back up to where we left off from P2. (2 weeks at maximum)
    - Rebuild robot.
    - Revive app.
    - Ensure the app - robot link works well.
- Funding ???!!?! Sandbox??? Q for Dr Oon - Any other leads we can chase down?
- Brainstorming for a more feasible product.
- Carry it out. 
- Test.
- Implement final changes + finalize everything.

## Qs for the Big Man
- Examples for past capstone projects so we can refer to when planning.
    - MC Submission
    - Item handoff locker - A or A+

## First session - some takeaways.
- We have to at least *recognise* legal & ethical issues in our presentation & report.
- Interim Report (individual) is due on Week 8.
- Final Showcase - Assume that both markers don't know anything about the project.
- Final Report (both group & individual) is due on Week 18. (30% of the final report is a group section)
- Internal conflict - Communication Is Key !

- Send Dr Oon details of Tetrix.

- Think about easier, more realistic use-cases.
- Current issues
    - Hygiene & spillage
    - Speed
- What's the real *value* of EatNow?
- Are there other industries that could use a solution like EatNow?

- The Other Option - Who Knows.
- Get temporary access for Who Knows to take a look at the code... Is it feasible?

### TODO
- Finalise idea at the end of Week 1.
- Setup user story board & share with Dr Oon.
- Start a new section on ePortfolio for Capstone Project.
- Add Dr Oon to WhatsApp group.
