# re: Design
The approaches to design can be very broadly categorised into 2 groups- **Technology-Centred** & **Human-Centred**. These approaches differ in several areas.

1. Their **focus**. A tech-centred approach to design places importance on the system's components. However, a human-centred approach designs for the target users in the forefront of their consideration.

1. Their **motivation**. A tech-centred approach means designers aim to develop the best design that will fulfil the project's use cases. Human-centred design approaches, however, aim to create a design that's most suited to an identified scenario.

1. Their **definition of quality**. Tech-centred design approaches are content with working products. Human-centred design approaches, on the other hand, are only content if the user can use the product in the intended way.

# The User Experience Design (UXD) Lifecycle
The subject of user experience is far from trivial. You can't expect to dive right into designing a product & hold any reasonable expectation to produce an award-winning design. Designing a good user experience is a long & detailed process. So, of course some guy came up with a paradigm for it. It's made up of 4 steps. Here they are.

## Understand
The first stage, arguably the most important stage, refers to gaining a comprehensive, accurate understanding of the project's requirements & the product's target users. Here we have some tried & tested methods that will bring you ever so much closer to true understanding.

### Gather Requirements
Essential! Ensures that your assumptions are lined up with the ground truth (of the users).

### User Analysis
Used to decide which research methods are most suitable.

#### User Research Methods (8 of them)

### Competitor Analysis
For understanding of the current market landscape.


## Analyse
So you've done your research. Now, make sense of it. Some common methods include forming **personas** & conjuring **user journeys**.

A persona is a fictional character constructed from the data collected from user research. The goal is typically to construct a representation of the project's target audience. This method is great for keeping UX designers focused on designing for the target users during the design process.

With your newly constructed persona, a user journey can be then conjured. This is, essentially, a *Day in the Life* that catalogues the daily activities of The Persona. User journeys can include an assorted mix of media- graphics, animations, what have you. User journeys, in comparison to personas, are able to provide more structure.

In this phase of the UXD lifecycle, we look at two aspects of content analysis.

### Content Audit
- Content Inventory
- Content Audit
- Content Templates
- Content Flow

### Content Organisation
- Card Sorting
- Sitemap
- Information Architecture


## Design
Apply yo design principles!

### Interface
We look at navigation design & layout.

### Interaction
- Learnability
- Memorability
- Error-proneness
- Efficiency
- Engagement

### Visual
- Contrast
- Repetition
- Alignment
- Proximity
- Colours
- Typography
- Space


## Validate
So you spent all this time & effort to birth design. However, is it **good**?

### Rapid Prototyping
An application prototype, like in Adobe XD (clickable! but not functional 😕) Used for showcasing purposes, along with preliminary testing of *flow*.

### Testing
Does it.. work?

#### Testing Techniques
- Backstage
- Front-stage
- Ad-hoc
- Observation

- Usability Testing
  - Pre-launch Testing
  - Post-launch Testing
- Multivariate Testing

### Analytics
If you won't trust intuition, you have to trust numbers! Receive metrics (sometimes real-time!) of things like monthly views, your conversion rate, etc.

Speaking of conversion rates... <mark style='background: rgb(210,210,210)'>did you know</mark>? Use of hamburger menus have been found to increase conversion rates (in comparison to visible navigation)!
