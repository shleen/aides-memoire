# re: Design
The approaches to design can be very broadly categorised into 2 groups- **Technology-Centred** & **Human-Centred**. These approaches differ in 3 key areas.

|                           | Tech-Centred Design | Human-Centred Design |
|---------------------------|---------------------|----------------------|
| **Focus** | Places importance on system components. | Keeps target users in consideration's forefront. |
| **Motivation** | Creates a design that best fulfils the project's use cases. | Creates a design that's most suited to a real world scenario. |
| **Definition of Quality** | Produces working products. | Produces products that can be used as intended. |

# The User Experience (UX) Team
As with any team, it's paramount that tasks are delegated systematically. Here are some key roles you'll find in pretty much any UX team.

- **UXD Director**
  - Responsible for the overall strategic development.
  - Reviews all UX decisions (as a sort of quality control).
  - Supports collaboration between disciplines that don't typically overlap.

- **Content Producer**
  - Responsible to maintain the harmony between content & design.
  - Works with the design team & client to ensure that both groups' visions remain aligned.

- **UX Designer**
  - Initially- spend time gaining full understanding of the project's context & target users.
  - Then- produce design artefacts like wireframes & storyboards.

# The User Experience Design (UXD) Lifecycle
The subject of user experience is far from trivial. It's illogical to dive head-first into designing a product & hold any reasonable expectation to produce an award-winning design. Creation of a good user experience is a long & detailed process. Naturally, we've developed a paradigm that hopes to provide some semblance of structure to the UXD process.

It is a collection of methods that form a design process where user experience is the prime concern. A good approach to this is **challenging the status quo**- i.e. being able to recognise existing pain points & develop effective (& sometimes novel) methods of alleviating them. Good user experience, however, is only possible if an **optimal balance** is maintained between providing the best experience for the user & keeping within time & monetary constraints.

With all that said, here are the 4 stages of the UXD lifecycle.

## 1. Understand
The first stage, arguably the most important stage, refers to gaining a comprehensive, accurate understanding of the project's requirements & its target users. This stage is Essential! It ensures that your assumptions are lined up with the users' ground truth. Here we have some tried & tested methods that will bring you that much closer to true enlightenment.

### User Analysis
Here we'll cover a smattering of user research methods. However, taking the point of **optimal balance** mentioned above, it's important to be able to identify the most suitable research method(s) for the project at hand. A good way to figure this one out is- looking at the target users.

Target users can first be either **internal** or **external**. & more specifically, internal users could refer to specific individuals or entire departments in an organisation while external users could refer to groups like suppliers or citizens.

For an illustration- conducting **focus groups** would serve to benefit a product that caters to an organisation's department a great deal more than one that caters to all citizens of a nation.

#### User Research Methods (8 of them)
- **Ethnography** Methods- actually following people around as they live their lives to try & understand their behaviour & culture.
- **Day in the Life**- cataloguing a person's daily activities using graphics & comic strips. Note that these activities include those outside the scope of the product. We're trying to gain a complete understanding of the person.
- **Eye Tracking**- Using specialised tools to identify how the user's attention is spread out when using a product. Useful for things like advertisements or search results.
- **Contextual Inquiry**- An interviewer observes a user interacting with a system. The interviewer then interviews the user.
- **Focus Groups**- pointed discussion among 5-12 individuals, typically moderated by a domain expert.
- **F2F Interviews**- wireframes/ a prototype is typically used as a prompt. Is very widely used but can be thought of as artificial or inefficient.
- **Card Sorting**- Users are given cards, indicative of the product's different functions & are asked to sort them into logical groups. Great for getting a good grasp of the users' mental models.
- **Persona**- Fictional character(s) formed through the team's understanding of the target audience. Requires some basis of user research but is great for keeping the team's design efforts on track throughout the design process.


Though there is no lack of user research methods that can be used by UXD teams, it still should be noted that it's not uncommon for teams to be faced with challenges. A common challenge faced by these designers is their **inability to translate their findings**. This means that they can carry out the research, they can collect the data. But, they're stuck there. They don't know how to translate the data into meaningful insights. On top of this, teams trying to design a completely novel product may face difficulty during research due to the **lack of precedence**. The best way to handle this is really to make as much use as possible of tools like wireframes & prototypes.

### Competitive Analysis
Sheds light on the current competition landscape. Is achieved through collaboration with multiple experts, using **heuristic evaluation**- making direct comparisons with design's best practices. This can prove to be extensively useful, with its ability to obtain quick & inexpensive feedback. These heuristic evaluation techniques are covered in detail below.

## 2. Analyse
So you've done your research. Now, make sense of it. Some common methods include forming **personas** & conjuring **user journeys**.

A persona is a fictional character constructed from the data collected from user research. The goal is typically to construct a representation of the project's target audience. This method is great for keeping UX designers focused on designing for the target users during the design process.

With your newly constructed persona, a user journey can be then conjured. This is, essentially, a *Day in the Life* that catalogues the daily activities of The Persona. User journeys can include an assorted mix of media- graphics, animations, what have you. User journeys, in comparison to personas, are able to provide more structure.

In this phase of the UXD lifecycle, we look at two aspects of content analysis.

### Content Strategy
The planning, creation, & delivery of ..content. This includes tasks like filtering the relevant, useful content & structuring this content to provide the best possible user experience.

#### Content Inventory
This means taking stock of all your content. i.e. all text, images, & documents. Some guiding questions to keep in mind during this phase include-

- What content do we have?
- How is it organised?
- Who creates it?
- Where is it housed?

#### Content Audit
Where the filtered content from before is evaluated for its (a) quality & (b) effectiveness. More guiding questions!

- What's the content's *point*?
- Is it accurate?
- How about useful?
- Does the audience even use it?
- Is it written professionally?
- Is it ..user-friendly?

This process is great, because it provides valuable insights like which pages have the highest conversion rate & which pages are irrelevant (& hence can & should be removed). On top of that, it serves as a pointer towards how you should handle this content. Here's a cool diagram for you visual learners ü§§

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/ChR5xby.png" width="500">

#### Content Templates
Provides a rough outline of (a) what content should be included & (b) the format in which this content should be displayed.

Contains meta-data covering details like
- Page title
- Primary message
- Purpose of the page
- Content guidelines

#### Editorial Calendar
An organiser for planning content to be published. Takes into consideration details like- the actual **content to publish**, a **prioritised list**  of things to publish, **effort required**, & **publishing destination**.

The real pros are past pen n paper. They've moved onto tools like Google Calendar or specialist software like DivvyHQ. Productivity + 100 üò≤

#### Content Flow
Determines how content moves through the editorial process, from its first conjugation all through the approval process, up to when it goes live.

### Content Organisation
#### Information Architecture
Structuring & classification of the content that can be found on a website. Is typically undertaken with the goal of making information more easily accessible to users.

Some of the tasks include-
- Transform raw data (all that *content*) into visible structures.
- Creation of a productive navigation system & content organisation. (i.e. sitemap)
- Identify relevant cross-links between content.


#### Sitemap
Provides a high-level depiction of the site's overall structure. There are several sitemap models that can be commonly found on the web, each serving a different purpose.

- **Strict Singular Hierarchy**

  <img src="https://i.imgur.com/KTUVPJL.png" width="200">

  Use of this model means that users can only access lower-level pages from its direct parent. This is useful in modelling a similar relationship in real-life, for example- arranging a company's office website pages based on their country. Or, websites with message boards that have multiple threads that each have their own set of posts.

- **Multi-Dimensional**

  <img src="https://i.imgur.com/FF3FNaA.png" width="200">

  Use of this model means that there are typically multiple ways to browse to the same content. For example, Amazon. Say, you're looking for a book to purchase. You might find it through browsing by genre, but you could also find it by browsing by title. In a way, you could say that this is an overlay of multiple hierarchies.

- **Hub**

  <img src="https://i.imgur.com/ClHyL4O.png" width="150">

  Suitable for sites with multiple distinct linear workflows. Each workflow doesn't overlap, & each layer of navigation will bring you deeper into the workflow. Perhaps the most common use of this model are email applications, where the inbox signifies the homepage & different tasks (e.g. sending an email, adding a contact) signifies a distinct workflow.

- **Search Driven**

  <img src="https://i.imgur.com/6Dtb5gp.png" width="200">

  Very good for quick access to content! Provides dynamic content views! Particularly beneficial for sites with large amounts of content & would like to not have users browse through hierarchies or indexes.


#### Card Sorting
A method to produce a site's information architecture, by getting user input.

- **Open Sorting**
  Users are provided with a set of cards, each labelled to represent a subsection of the site. Users go ham. This method is used when the design team has sufficient time, (it's quite a long process), when there is no existing navigational structure, or if you'd like to do a complete overhaul of the current navigational structure.

- **Closed Sorting**
  Users receive the same cards from before but instead of having them go ham, they instead sort these cards into pre-determined categories.


## 3. Design
Apply yo design principles!

### Interface
We look at navigation design & layout.

#### Navigation Design
Serves to orientate & guide users. Tackles key questions like-

##### Types of Navigation
- **Global (Primary) Navigation**<br>
  Provides users with the broadest access to content in the site. Global navigation is typically kept to a maximum of **7** tabs, all of which remain **static & prominent** across the site. Gives the user their **current location**.

- **Secondary Navigation**<br>
  Provides access to the next level of items beneath the items in the global navigation. e.g. horizontal sub-navbar (think Singtel) or a left vertical navbar. Gives the user their **current location**.

- **Breadcrumb Navigation**<br>
  Are either **path-based** or **location-based**. Path-based breadcrumbs are **dynamically** generated, & depict the path taken by the user to reach the page they're currently on. In contrast, location-based breadcrumbs are **statically** generated, & depict the page the user is currently on in relation to the site's hierarchy.

  This navigational layout is valuable for how users can navigate to previous pages (or pages higher in the site hierarchy) with one click. Is expected of larger sites that house deeper content hierarchies. Depicts **where the user came from**.

- **Contextual Navigation**<br>
  Links from the body of a web page to other relevant (but not present in the user's current location). e.g. hyperlinks in a paragraph, or "You might also like..." sections in e-commerce sites. This navigational layout is commonly used with the wish for users to *explore*. Be wary, however, for this navigational layout can really only be done well with a superb understanding of the user base. Tells the user where they can go **from here**.

- **Search-based Navigation**<br>
  Is the holy-grail for users that know exactly what they want. This navigational layout is gaining traction, as navigation through websites is becoming an intuitive skill for growing population. However, this navigational layout is almost never used as a website's chief navigation, for obvious reasons. Rather, it's used as supplementation to a more traditional navigational layout like global navigation. How users can **get somewhere else**.

- **Faceted Navigation**<br>
  A plugin to the traditional search- users can now filter results on a web page by a set of pre-determined attributes. This adds *dimensionality* to the traditional search, & is almost a standard for e-commerce sites offering products of various types. Part of its charm comes from the fact that these facets are chosen by the user themselves, thus providing a type of user-customised search. How users can **get somewhere else**.


#### Layout

### Interaction
- Learnability
- Memorability
- Error-proneness
- Efficiency
- Engagement

### Visual
- Contrast
- Repetition
- Alignment
- Proximity
- Colours
- Typography
- Space


## 4. Validate
So you spent all this time & effort to birth design. However, is it **good**?

### Rapid Prototyping
An application prototype, like in Adobe XD (clickable! but not functional üòï) Used for showcasing purposes, along with preliminary testing of *flow*.

### Testing
Does it.. work?

#### Testing Techniques
- Backstage
- Front-stage
- Ad-hoc
- Observation

- Usability Testing
  - Pre-launch Testing
  - Post-launch Testing
- Multivariate Testing

### Analytics
If you won't trust intuition, you have to trust numbers! Receive metrics (sometimes real-time!) of things like monthly views, your conversion rate, etc.

Speaking of conversion rates... <mark style='background: rgb(210,210,210)'>did you know</mark>? Use of hamburger menus have been found to increase conversion rates (in comparison to visible navigation)!
