# re: Design
The approaches to design can be very broadly categorised into 2 groups- **Technology-Centred** & **Human-Centred**. These approaches differ in 3 key areas.

|                           | Tech-Centred Design | Human-Centred Design |
|---------------------------|---------------------|----------------------|
| **Focus** | Places importance on system components. | Keeps target users in consideration's forefront. |
| **Motivation** | Creates a design that best fulfils the project's use cases. | Creates a design that's most suited to a real world scenario. |
| **Definition of Quality** | Produces working products. | Produces products that can be used as intended. |

# The User Experience (UX) Team
As with any team, it's paramount that tasks are delegated systematically. Here are some key roles you'll find in pretty much any UX team.

- **UXD Director**
  - Responsible for the overall strategic development.
  - Reviews all UX decisions (as a sort of quality control).
  - Supports collaboration between disciplines that don't typically overlap.

- **Content Producer**
  - Responsible to maintain the harmony between content & design.
  - Ensures the visions of the UXD team & the client are aligned.

- **UX Designer**
  - Initially- spend time gaining full understanding of the project's context & target users.
  - Then- produce design artefacts like wireframes & storyboards.

# The User Experience Design (UXD) Lifecycle
The subject of user experience is far from trivial. It's illogical to dive head-first into designing a product & hold any reasonable expectation to produce an award-winning design. Creation of a good UXD is a long & detailed process. Naturally, we've developed a paradigm that hopes to provide some semblance of structure to the UXD process.

It is a collection of methods that form a design process where user experience is the prime concern. A good approach to this is **challenging the status quo**- i.e. being able to recognise existing pain points & develop effective (& sometimes novel) methods of alleviating them. Good user experience, however, is only possible if an **optimal balance** is maintained between providing the best experience for the user & keeping within time & monetary constraints.

With all that said, here are the 4 stages of the UXD lifecycle.

## 1. Understand
The goal of this first stage is- to gain comprehensive, accurate understanding of the project's requirements & its target users. This stage is Essential for it ensures that your assumptions are lined up with the users' ground truth. Here we have some tried & tested methods that will bring you that much closer to enlightenment.

### User Analysis
Here we'll cover a smattering of user research methods. 8 of them, to be specific. However, going back to the point of **optimal balance**, it's important to be able to identify the most suitable research method(s) for each project. You could probably figure this one out by looking at the target users.

Target users can first be either **internal** or **external**. More specifically, internal users refers to specific individuals or entire departments in an organisation while external users refers to groups like suppliers or citizens.

For an illustration- conducting **focus groups** would serve to benefit a product that caters to an organisation's department a great deal more than one that caters to all Singaporeans.

#### User Research Methods
- **Card Sorting**- Users are given cards that represent the product's functions & are asked to sort them into logical groups. This provides immense help to researchers in discovering how users understand & categorise information.
- **Contextual Inquiry**- An interviewer observes a user interacting with a system. The interviewer then poses directed, strategic practical questions to the user.
- **Day in the Life**- cataloguing a person's daily activities using graphics & comic strips. We're trying to observe & understand their daily routine.
- **Ethnography**- Following people around their lives to try & understand why they live the way they live. Ethnography is so powerful because people are often unable to articulate what they want from a product or service. Ethnography is then able to figure out for the people what it is they want. Note that this observation is non-directed, which leads to ethnography's downside- it's inefficient.
- **Eye Tracking**- Using specialised tools to identify how the user's attention is spread out when using a product. Useful for things like advertisements or search results.
- **Persona**- Fictional character(s) formed based on the team's understanding of the target audience. Requires some prior user research or data but is great for keeping the team's design efforts on track throughout the design process.
- **F2F Interviews**- wireframes/ a prototype is typically used as a prompt. Is very widely used but can be thought of as artificial or inefficient.
- **Focus Groups**- pointed discussion among 5-12 individuals, typically moderated by a domain expert.

Though there is no lack of user research methods that can be used by UXD teams, it still should be noted that it's not uncommon for teams to be faced with challenges. A common challenge faced by these designers is their **inability to translate their findings**. This means that they can carry out the research, they can collect the data. But, they're stuck there. They don't know how to translate the data into meaningful insights. On top of this, teams trying to design a completely novel product may face difficulty during research due to the **lack of precedence**. The best way to handle this is really to make as much use as possible of tools like wireframes & prototypes.

### Competitive Analysis
Sheds light on the current competition landscape. Is achieved through collaboration with multiple experts, using **heuristic evaluation**- making direct comparisons with design's best practices. This can prove to be extensively useful, with its ability to obtain quick & inexpensive feedback. These heuristic evaluation techniques are covered in detail below.

#### Heuristic Evaluation

    - prevent errors
    - errors are explanatory & easy to recover from
    - minimal mental workload 🧠

    - remember user preference

## 2. Analyse
So you've done your research. Now, make sense of it. In this phase of the UXD lifecycle, we look at two aspects of content analysis.

### Content Strategy
The planning, creation, & delivery of ..content. This includes tasks like filtering the relevant, useful content & structuring this content to provide the best possible user experience.

#### Content Inventory
This means taking stock of all your content. i.e. all text, images, & documents. Some guiding questions to keep in mind during this phase include-

- What content do we have?
- How is it organised?
- Who creates it?
- Where is it housed?

#### Content Audit
Where the filtered content from before is evaluated for its (a) quality & (b) effectiveness. More guiding questions!

- What's the content's *point*?
- Is it accurate?
- How about useful?
- Does the audience even use it?
- Is it written professionally?
- Is it ..user-friendly?

This process is great, because it provides valuable insights like which pages have the highest conversion rate & which pages are irrelevant (& hence can & should be removed). On top of that, it serves as a pointer towards how you should handle this content. Here's a cool diagram for you visual learners 🤤

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/ChR5xby.png" width="500">

#### Content Templates
Provides a rough outline of (a) what content should be included & (b) the format in which this content should be displayed.

Contains meta-data covering details like
- Page title
- Primary message
- Purpose of the page
- Content guidelines

#### Editorial Calendar
An organiser for planning content to be published. Takes into consideration details like- the actual **content to publish**, a **prioritised list**  of things to publish, **effort required**, & **publishing destination**.

The real pros are past pen n paper. They've moved onto tools like Google Calendar or specialist software like DivvyHQ. Productivity + 100 😲

#### Content Flow
Determines how content moves through the editorial process, from its first conjuring all through the approval process, up to when it goes live.

### Content Organisation
#### Information Architecture
Structuring & classification of the content that can be found on a website. Is typically undertaken with the goal of making information more easily accessible to users.

Some of the tasks include-
- Transform raw data (all that *content*) into visible structures.
- Creation of a productive navigation system & content organisation. (i.e. sitemap)
- Identify relevant cross-links between content.


#### Sitemap
Provides a high-level depiction of the site's overall structure. There are several sitemap models that can be commonly found on the web, each serving a different purpose.

- **Strict Singular Hierarchy**

  <img src="https://i.imgur.com/KTUVPJL.png" width="200">

  Use of this model means that users can only access lower-level pages from its direct parent. This is useful in modelling a similar relationship in real-life, for example- arranging a company's office website pages based on their country. Or, websites with message boards that have multiple threads that each have their own set of posts.

- **Multi-Dimensional**

  <img src="https://i.imgur.com/FF3FNaA.png" width="200">

  Use of this model means that there are typically multiple ways to browse to the same content. For example, Amazon. Say, you're looking for a book to purchase. You might find it through browsing by genre, but you could also find it by browsing by title. In a way, you could say that this is an overlay of multiple hierarchies.

- **Hub**

  <img src="https://i.imgur.com/ClHyL4O.png" width="150">

  Suitable for sites with multiple distinct linear workflows. Each workflow doesn't overlap, & each layer of navigation will bring you deeper into the workflow. Perhaps the most common use of this model are email applications, where the inbox signifies the homepage & different tasks (e.g. sending an email, adding a contact) signifies a distinct workflow.

- **Search Driven**

  <img src="https://i.imgur.com/6Dtb5gp.png" width="200">

  Very good for quick access to content! Provides dynamic content views! Particularly beneficial for sites with large amounts of content & would like to not have users browse through hierarchies or indexes.


#### Card Sorting
A method to produce a site's information architecture, by getting user input.

- **Open Sorting**
  Users are provided with a set of cards, each labelled to represent a subsection of the site. Users go ham. This method is used when the design team has sufficient time, (it's quite a long process), when there is no existing navigational structure, or if you'd like to do a complete overhaul of the current navigational structure.

- **Closed Sorting**
  Users receive the same cards from before but instead of having them go ham, they instead sort these cards into pre-determined categories.


## 3. Design
Apply yo design principles!

### Interface
We look at navigation design & layout.

#### Navigation Design
Serves to orientate & guide users. Tackles key questions like-

##### Types of Navigation
- **Global (Primary) Navigation**<br>
  Provides users with the broadest access to content in the site. Global navigation is typically kept to a maximum of **7** tabs, all of which remain **static & prominent** across the site. Gives the user their **current location**.

- **Secondary Navigation**<br>
  Provides access to the next level of items beneath the items in the global navigation. e.g. horizontal sub-navbar (think Singtel) or a left vertical navbar. Gives the user their **current location**.

- **Breadcrumb Navigation**<br>
  Are either **path-based** or **location-based**. Path-based breadcrumbs are **dynamically** generated, & depict the path taken by the user to reach the page they're currently on. In contrast, location-based breadcrumbs are **statically** generated, & depict the page the user is currently on in relation to the site's hierarchy.

  This navigational layout is valuable for how users can navigate to previous pages (or pages higher in the site hierarchy) with one click. Is expected of larger sites that house deeper content hierarchies. Depicts **where the user came from**.

- **Contextual Navigation**<br>
  Links from the body of a web page to other relevant (but not present in the user's current location). e.g. hyperlinks in a paragraph, or "You might also like..." sections in e-commerce sites. This navigational layout is commonly used with the wish for users to *explore*. Be wary, however, for this navigational layout can really only be done well with a superb understanding of the user base. Tells the user where they can go **from here**.

- **Search-based Navigation**<br>
  Is the holy-grail for users that know exactly what they want. This navigational layout is gaining traction, as navigation through websites is becoming an intuitive skill for growing population. However, this navigational layout is almost never used as a website's chief navigation, for obvious reasons. Rather, it's used as supplementation to a more traditional navigational layout like global navigation. How users can **get somewhere else**.

- **Faceted Navigation**<br>
  A plugin to the traditional search- users can now filter results on a web page by a set of pre-determined attributes. This adds *dimensionality* to the traditional search, & is almost a standard for e-commerce sites offering products of various types. Part of its charm comes from the fact that these facets are chosen by the user themselves, thus providing a type of user-customised search. How users can **get somewhere else**.


#### Layout
Here, we explore a wealth of content presentation strategies.

- **Springboard**<br>
  Is effective for presenting users with a content overview- the main functions available & such, to which users are able to *jump* right into. This would explain its name 🧐. Holds value in it's **customisability**. Users could choose their most frequently used functions that they'd like direct access to.

  Favoured not uncommonly for the possible use of icons (pictorials!) that allows apps to convey *more with less*, & even show off a bit of their design if they so desire!

- **List**<br>
  Like springboards, lists let users jump right into the application content. Are particularly useful for long titles or sites that require that extra bit of text in their labels. Conveys simplicity & coherence.

- **Tab**<br>
  Can be used as an app's primary navigation, meaning it's static across all pages in the app. Good for multiple functions with similar priorities.

- **Gallery**<br>
  Using a thumbnail image (+ maybe a short title) to display a gallery of content. Particularly pertinent for content that sees frequent updates.

- **Slide to Reveal**<br>
  A list that's revealed by clicking on a hamburger button or swiping into the page. When revealed, takes the form of a list. Suitable for longer lists of items!

We place so much emphasis on content layout because people don't read anymore, they just **scan**. It's thus important to create a visual hierarchy using these layout elements & other tricks (like font colour or size) to ensure that users can get the most out of our site in the least amount of time.

### Interaction
Interaction design revolves around 5 key points.

- **Engagement** <br>
  The site should be **pleasant** to use. A good strategy is a liberal use of visuals in immersive interfaces that are able to provide users with some measure of **personalisation**.

- **Memorability** <br>
  This refers to the ease with which a user can use an interface when they return to it after a period of time. Is achieved using **conventions** & **standards**, for obvious reasons. These tactics tap on the knowledge users have from life in general & are reinforced in the users' everyday lives (even when not interacting with your product). A good measure for the importance of memorability is the frequency with which users are expected to use the product. Higher frequencies typically translate to proportionally higher importance for memorability.

  For example, ATMs & cab booking apps. Users don't want to have to re-learn the entire system every time they make a transaction. They want quick, snappy, & smooooth experiences.

- **Error-proneness** <br>
  This means 2 things- first, that errors should be prevented wherever possible. Achieve this by implementing client-side input validation & preceding permanent changes with warning messages. Next, when errors do eventually happen, they should be relatively easy to recover from. This means accompanying any errors with helpful messages that will provide more aid than frustration, & giving users the autonomy to undo & redo their actions.

  **How to write a Good Error Message** <br>
  You're going to want to keep it precise & clear, with 3 points.
  - providing **notification** that something went wrong
  - a **diagnosis** of the error
  - the best **course of action**

  tip: inject some of that human-juice into it with a tinge of humour <br>
  also! spend time on your 404 page! think **helpful**

- **Efficiency** <br>
  Any task should require only as much work as is minimally necessary. As a designer, it's important to keep all types of users in mind! Provide step-by-step guides for novice users & useful shortcuts for power users. Keeping your tasks intuitive also helps with this!

- **Learnability** <br>
  This refers to how quickly users can complete a task the first time they encounter it. The goal should always be to minimise cognitive load. Again, this is where conventions & standards should be followed. Expecting users to completely relearn a process they're already familiar is painfully unproductive.

  **3 Ways to Design a Learnable Interface**
  1. **Metaphor** <br>
    Drawing parallels between the new interface & a mental model that the user probably already has. This makes use of the users' instincts, & aids in reducing the mental effort required of a user when taking on novel tasks. An example of this in action is- the use of a gear icon to symbolise the settings page.

  1. **Affordance** <br>
    Visual cues. These serve as suggestion to how a user should act in the face of a new task, & also serves to reduce mental effort required of them. For example, *push* doors without handles.

  1. **Progressive Disclosure** <br>
    As can be inferred by its name, this means presenting users with only the information necessary to accomplish the current task. For example, using collapsible divisions in a web page. (note, though, that the first division should be open, to provide users with affordance of how it works)

### Visual
Visual design. We can actually break it down into 7 main principles.

- **Contrast**- Refers to the juxtaposition of multiple elements with differing colours or typefaces. Very effective in creating visual interest!

- **Repetition**- Makes use of the our brains' tendency to search for patterns in everything. Encourages the transition from short to long-term memory, thus improving recall. Some standard applications of repetition- the colour of buttons & page layouts.

- **Alignment**- Just, don't place anything *in the middle of nowhere*. Elements on a page should be related to one another, in one way or another.

- **Proximity**- Aids content organisation, which gets increasingly important as the amount of content grows. Make use of the fact that our brains are able to form links between elements in close proximity & create visual units. A good rule of thumb is that elements should be visually grouped as they are intellectually grouped.

- **Colours**- so! much! potential! Let's see..

  **Red** <br>
  Highly stimulating & energising, immensely effective for catching attention. Gives off a powerful vibe that isn't that effective if you're trying to keep your users relaxed. Explains why fast-food restaurants *love* red.

  **Orange** <br>
  Like red, is energising, though to a smaller degree. Is therefore more effective in relaying cheerfulness, over red's powerful-ness.

  **Yellow** <br>
  Is interesting because its difference in shade & vibrancy translates to a difference in impact. Is generally warm & energetic, though bright yellows are **extremely** stimulating while middle shades feel warm & welcoming & darker shades like gold give off a unique timelessness.

  **Green** <br>
  Bridges warm & dark colours & provides an energy that also speaks relaxation??!? Commonly signifies +/ve growth!

  **Blue** <br>
  Light blues fels safe & inviting, & are therefore used by social sites like Facebook & Twitter. Dark blues, on the other hand, gives off an overwhelming calmness, that feels more somber than light blues. Is therefore commonly tied with impressions of professionalism.

  **Purple** <br>
  Feels luxurious & royal, with lighter shades giving off romantic vibes whereas darker shades carry a sense of mystery.

  **Black** <br>
  Use of black as a main colour is typically discouraged. Rather, look into using black to support & enhance some other colours. Make use of the subtle sense of power & sophistication that it exudes.

  **White** <br>
  Oh, clean & pure, virtuous white! Works wonders in drawing attention to more stimulating elements, so consider using white as a supporting colour in these situations.

  **Grey** <br>
  Feels neutral. Though, it's ability to convey a wide spectrum of emotions should be overlooked! Just think about how light greys make you feel differently from dark greys!

  Read 'til the end to find out about how colours are mixed to amplify their emotional impact!

- **Typography** <br>
  We can cover the great big world of typography sufficiently comprehensively with **3** basic principles.

  1. **Type Categories**- serif vs sans-serif typefaces.
  1. **Type Families**- i.e. light, regular, bold, italic, etc.
  1. **Letterform shapes & strokes**- the width of the lines in each character. Uniform stroke between characters is the way to go!

  **Use of typography in design**
  - **Oversized lettering**- meaning dominating over other elements, with its large size & heavy weight. Here are some ways this is achieved.
    1. Colour. Using straight black or white text over a super bright background.
    1. Alignment. L, R, or centralised.
    1. Caps. Deliberate caps.
    1. Deliberately Large. Almost causes a sense of discomfort. But great for grabbing attention.
  - **Super Small**- is then typically black, with thicker stroke to counteract the small-ness. Can be used to create contrast, with large text or images.
  - **Integration with Images**- emphasises the impact of the text or image by putting them together. Note that it's important to ensure that the image & text are conveying the same point. Otherwise, this could cause unwanted confusion. Also, don't go blockin' key parts of the image...
    1. Type **in** Image- instead of the text having a solid colour fill, it's filled with an image. Note to use large, strong type here.
    1. Type **on** Image- just, text juxtaposed onto an image.
    1. Type **with** Image-
  - **Embellishment**- e.g. adding drop shadows or artistic flourishes to text.
  - **Custom Type**- especially pertinent for things like logos or branding where you want to give off a specific vibe. Be wary though, there is a lot of work that goes into creating a custom type behind the scenes! e.g. ensuring cross-browser & device compatibility.

- **Space** <br>
  It's important to be able to understand that the number of elements on a page correlates directly with the amount of impact each element has. Also, more space on a page is typically linked with luxury. Nobody's attracted to a cluttered site!

#### Mixing Colours
- **Monochromatic**- using different shades of one colour. Is visually appealing, & are commonly found in minimalist designs. Feels *elegant*.
- **Analogous**- using neighbouring colours on the colour wheel. Is typically made of a primary colour that is most dominant, supplemented by a less intense secondary element, & completed by a third accent colour. Also visually appealing, while being easy on the eyes. Good if you want more diversity than monochromatic schemes can provide! Gives off a calming, harmonious vibe.
- **Complementary**- using opposing colours on the colour wheel to create a dynamic, stimulating visual. Good for content that aims to be easily digested, but not so for pages intending to give off calming vibes. Works best with saturated colours!
- **Triadic**- very safe! using a set of three colours that form an equilateral triangle on the colour wheel. Good for the fact that it appeals to a large audience, though not that good for calling attention to specific sections of a page.

### Images
It's not uncommon to hear people preach about the usefulness of images. Today, we uncover the basis of that stance.

#### The benefits of Images
- Images can convey much more information than text can. Actually, **6** times more information. Additionally, people have better recall for images (as compared to it's plain text counterpart). Follow these few tips for Maximum Effectiveness!
  1. Avoid using similar images (this basically counteracts all the benefits of using images)
  1. Use images with consistent style/ subject
  1. Strive to use unique, memorable images
- Use of images over text provides **accessibility** benefits. As an example, it's more likely for populations (including possibly illiterate elderly) to be able to understand images as compared to a long paragraph of text. Beware, however, that this *picture superiority effect* is less pronounced (possibly to the point of a disadvantage) in children.
- **Better retention**. It's been found that users are able to retain **6** times the information of a site (after 3 days) that makes use of images to supplement text as compared to sites that use only textual content.
- **Quicker processing**- users process visual information **60,000** times faster than their textual counterparts. This benefit is especially prominent in sites for complex products that would otherwise need a significant amount of text to get their job done.
- **Instant evocation of emotions**. Perfect for the purposes of telling a story or making an impactful point. Do avoid this if your point is to evoke relaxation!

#### Types of Images
1. **Iconic** images. These are universal, literal images that even people unfamiliar with these images are able to get a general meaning. e.g. female/ male restroom symbols, or an icon of a trash can to indicate a deletion task. There's little need for these images to be labelled! The images themselves *are* the labels.
1. **Symbolic** images. These images are one order above iconic images in terms of their abstraction. They are able to convey a general meaning, though people unfamiliar with them would need a nudge in the right direction in order to understand it correctly.
1. **Indexical** images. Your typical images that are able to *speak a thousand words*.

#### Types of Image Styles
1. **Illustrations**. Appropriate in situations where realism isn't the top priority, or when a diagram/ flowchart would aid the process of getting the point across to the user.
1. Use of a **mascot**. Is a manifestation of your brand's design. The best mascots are *dynamic*! They're super effective for creating emotional connections with your users (which increases conversions!). You can use them in step-by-step guides over static text on a page!
1. Don't underestimate an image's **background**! They're super powerful in reinforcing your point. Changing the background of an image/ page adds dimensionality to your site while keeping some extent of consistency, so your users don't get motion sick.

  If you do opt to use a background video, here are some points you should keep it relatively short, without sound. Do also pay attention to load times & cross-device compatibility. Please also use only quality videos!
1. Personalisation. This is in terms of your brand, to set yourselves apart from your competitors. If your budget can handle it, custom images would go a long way. It'll not only make your brand more memorable, you'll also be able to convey your points more succinctly & effectively.

#### Engaging Storytelling- a How To
- **Make your user into the subject of the story**. e.g. use any personal information you have to provide personalised stats or functions.
- **Gamify** your site. Create a system of risk & reward, where users can gain some type of reward (some visual change works *wonders*) for completing a task. This gratification goes a long way with people! Think Todoist's karma system! Use of this technique needs careful calibration, though! This technique can be used to cultivate user habits. First, provide some visual **cue**. This cue should cause them to do some **routine** task. Once done, **reward** them. Make use of this cue-routine-reward loop!
- Inject **interactivity** into common actions. This means making use of text & images to add value to clicking & scrolling. e.g. scroll-triggered animations or enticing search-bar placeholder text.
- **Easter eggs**! This means well-hidden features or messages. This is almost a type of gamification that adds a layer of excitement to the experience. Sites suited for this method are- gaming-related sites, giveaway sites, or sites whose aim is to provide lighthearted fun to their users. e.g. Google's Atari Breakout hidden in the image search results.
- **Big picture thinking**. You are, after all, trying to tell a story. It doesn't hurt to give it a bit of structure. This is at least for the beginning, middle, & end of the site.

  **Beginning**- where you plant your stimulus! This means things like promotions & contest banners. <br>
  **Middle**- your hook! Engage your users! Show off your shiny testimonials, awards. <br>
  **End**- go in for the kill! Place your call to actions here! Buy Now! or contact information, etc.


## 4. Validate
So you spent all this time & effort to birth design. However, is it **good**?

### Rapid Prototyping
An application prototype, like in Adobe XD (clickable! but not functional 😕) Used for showcasing purposes, along with preliminary testing of *flow*.

### Testing
Does it.. work?

#### Testing Techniques
- Backstage
- Front-stage
- Ad-hoc
- Observation

- Usability Testing
  - Pre-launch Testing
  - Post-launch Testing
- Multivariate Testing

### Analytics
If you won't trust intuition, you have to trust numbers! Receive metrics (sometimes real-time!) of things like monthly views, your conversion rate, etc.

Speaking of conversion rates... <mark style='background: rgb(210,210,210)'>did you know</mark>? Use of hamburger menus have been found to increase conversion rates (in comparison to visible navigation)!

### UX Checklist Summary
