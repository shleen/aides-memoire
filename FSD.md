# Software Development Methodologies
Software & IT forms part of a very much legitimate industry. There is a need for increasingly complex systems to be built. These tasks are very nearly impossible to accomplish without a comprehensive plan. & since it really doesn't make sense to develop an entire system before embarking on a new project. So, methodologies!

These methodologies can be charted on a spectrum, ranging from **predictive, plan-driven** schemes like the Waterfall model, to **adaptive, change-driven** schemes like the Agile model.

## The Waterfall Methodology
Loosely analogous to construction & manufacturing workflows, in the sense that it is highly **sequential**. Maybe its most distinctive characteristic is it's policy of no backtracking. Completion of the design process is completion of the design process.

This means that projects developed with this methodology typically share several characteristics.

1. (very) **specific project requirements**. It's pretty self-explanatory why.

1. **Stable project requirements**. Likewise for this point.

1. **A need for documentation**. The waterfall methodology's sequential design provides the necessary structure & resources to document the project.

1. **Strict timeline**. Product owners can know how much to expect from their product in their specified amount of time because all the planning for the project happens beforehand.

1. (sometimes) **uninvolved product owner**. The product owner's involvement is only really required in the project requirements specification part of the process. Product owners that don't want to or cannot get involved with the development of their product would therefore opt for this methodology.

1. (relatively) **low importance of speed**. Waterfall is a meticulous process.

So maybe you have a project you want to embark on. But, you've hit a dilemma- which development methodology?! ðŸ˜§ Well, here are some advantages & disadvantages of the waterfall methodology. Maybe they'll help.

#### Advantages
- Future improvements to the program can be made easily, thanks to the methodology's heavy emphasis on meticulous documentation.

- The product owner gets what they asked for, & they know it. Details like size, cost, & timeline are always well-defined.

- Low dependence on development team. This goes back to waterfall's thing for documentation. Another developer can pick up from where one left off easily.


#### Disadvantages
- Don't even dream of returning to a previous stage!

- Better not dream of changing the project's requirements, either!

- You could say that everything hinges on the project's initial requirements. It's do or die.

- Testing only happens at the end of the process ðŸ˜• & we all know how errors can cascade.

## The Agile Methodology
In stark contrast to the waterfall methodology, the agile methodology makes use of an incremental approach.

A project typically begins with a simple set of requirements that are formed on the basis of knowing that requirements can be changed whenever. The project is developed in small modules, where testing & deployment happen regularly.

Of course you'll need a set of advantages & disadvantages, to compare with those of the waterfall methodology.

#### Advantages
- Changes to the project requirements are not only tolerated, but rather, are expected.

- The systems that are built are up-to-date with current technologies.

- The product owner is able to give feedback in short, regular intervals, so as to ensure that the development process will produce the product they envisioned.

- Regular testing means bugs are found & fixed early on!

- Builds systems that, characteristically, can be deployed whenever. These projects are, therefore, more likely to make good on the product's launch date.

#### Disadvantages
- 

### A Sprint
The building blocks of an agile development process. Consists of the all-important

- sprint planning
- sprint review
- daily stand-ups
