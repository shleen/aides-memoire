# Software Development Methodologies
The IT industry is very much legitimate. There is a demand for increasingly complex systems. These systems are very nearly impossible to build without a comprehensive plan. Since it doesn't make sense to devise a plan from scratch before each new project, we have methodologies!

These methodologies can be charted on a spectrum, ranging from **predictive, plan-driven** schemes like the Waterfall model, to **adaptive, change-driven** schemes like the Agile model.

## The Waterfall Methodology
Loosely analogous to construction & manufacturing workflows, in the sense that the waterfall methodology is highly **sequential**, where it's policy of no backtracking is perhaps its most distinctive characteristic.

Projects developed with this methodology typically share several characteristics.

1. (very) **specific & stable project requirements**. It's pretty self-explanatory why.

1. **A need for documentation**. The waterfall methodology's sequential design provides the necessary structure & resources to document the project.

1. **Strict timeline**. Product owners can know how much to expect from their product in their specified amount of time because all the planning for the project happens beforehand.

1. (sometimes) **uninvolved product owner**. The product owner's involvement is only really required in the project requirements specification part of the process. Product owners that don't want to or cannot get involved with the development of their product would therefore opt for this methodology.

1. (relatively) **low importance of speed**. Waterfall is a meticulous process.

So maybe you have a project you want to embark on. But, you've hit a dilemma- which development methodology?! üòß Well, here are some advantages & disadvantages of the waterfall methodology. Maybe they'll help.

#### Advantages
- Future improvements to the program can be made easily, thanks to the methodology's heavy emphasis on meticulous documentation.

- The product owner gets what they asked for, & they know it. Details like size, cost, & timeline are always well-defined.

- Low dependence on development team. This goes back to waterfall's thing for documentation. Another developer can pick up from where one left off easily.


#### Disadvantages
- Don't even dream of returning to a previous stage!

- Better not dream of changing the project's requirements, either!

- You could say that everything hinges on the project's initial requirements. It's do or die.

- Testing only happens at the end of the process üòï & we all know how errors can cascade.

## The Agile Methodology
In stark contrast to the waterfall methodology, the agile methodology makes use of an incremental approach.

A project typically begins with a simple set of requirements that are formed on the basis of knowing that requirements can be changed whenever. The project is developed in small modules, where testing & deployment happen regularly.

Of course you'll need a set of advantages & disadvantages, to compare with those of the waterfall methodology.

#### Advantages
- Changes to the project requirements are not only tolerated, but rather, are expected.

- The systems that are built are up-to-date with current technologies.

- The product owner is able to give feedback in short, regular intervals, so as to ensure that the development process will produce the product they envisioned.

- Regular testing means bugs are found & fixed early on!

- Builds systems that, characteristically, can be deployed whenever. These projects are, therefore, more likely to make good on the product's launch date.

#### Disadvantages
- An incompetent project manager can lead to a late & over budget product.

- There is a (significant) chance for the final product to be completely different than what was intended at the beginning of the project.

With these points in mind, there are then of course a set of common features in projects suited to the Agile methodology.

1. **Rapid production is important**. Agile is really good for producing a market-ready product quickly.

1. Product owner wants **flexibility** or the project's nature requires for the requirements to be able to change during the development process.

1. When there is **no strict picture of the final product**. This is where agile's incremental approach rocks.

1. **Motivated & skilled developers**.

### The Agile Manifesto
The baseline of The Agile Methodology. Consists of 4 values & 12 principles.

#### The 4 Values of Agile
- Individuals & Interactions **>** Processes & Tools
- Working software **>** Comprehensive documentation
- Customer Collaboration **>** Contract Negotiation
- Change-driven **>** Plan-driven

#### The 12 Guiding Principles of Agile
1. The Priority- **Customer Satisfaction**. This is accomplished with early & continuous delivery of software.

1. Changing requirements should be **welcomed**.

1. Software should be **delivered frequently**. This opens up a continuous flow of user/ client feedback.

1. There should be **daily collaboration** between the product owner & the development team. This looks like frequent demos & opportunities to fine tune the project requirements.

1. Build a team of **competent & motivated** developers; provide them with support & trust them to get the job done.

1. Nothing beats **face-to-face conversation**.

1. Progress is measured by **working software**.

1. **Sustainable development**! Agile development teams should be able to maintain their pace indefinitely.

1. Applaud **technical excellence & good design**.

1. The goal is to **do the least amount of work possible**.

1. Give the team **autonomy**. Self-organisation beats all other types of organisation.

1. **Frequent retrospectives** work amazingly to help the team increase their productivity.

In this module, we will look mainly at the Scrum framework of the Agile methodology.

## Agile Framework- Scrum
Lightweight! Is built on **sprints** & maintains light overhead by maximising the time spent doing work. Good for complex projects, as it'll break it down into smaller, more manageable blocks.

### A Sprint
The building blocks of the Scrum framework. Consists of the all-important
- sprint planning
- sprint review
- daily stand-ups

#### Sprint Review vs Sprint Retrospective
Sprint reviews are product-oriented, to gather feedback on what has been built in the past print. Whereas sprint retrospectives are team-oriented, with the goal of improving the team's productivity.

### Benefits
- ‚¨ÜÔ∏è quality of deliverables
- Responds well to changing requirements
- Provides better estimates, quicker
- Provides better control over the project schedule

### Non-Benefits
- No exact deadlines, things are quite in the air

# Group Development & Conflict Resolution

## The Importance of Group Development
A group of talented people != a good team. An effective, high-functioning team is cultivated!

## The Stages in Group Development
Breaking this group development process into distinct stages aims to create high-performing teams. The different stages of group development are significant for the differing levels of productivity between them. These productivity levels are visualised below.

![Team Effectiveness against Performance Impact](https://i.imgur.com/HqgUVmC.png)

### Forming
Teammates become acquainted with each other. A *first date*, if you will. Some topics of conversation that are likely to come up include-

- teammates' skills & their background
- the project's goals & its timeline
- some ground rules
- individual roles

A lack of productivity at this stage is somewhat expected, since tasks are people-oriented, team members are focused on getting to know each other rather than getting work done.

#### Tips for sustainability in Forming
- Communication is key! Talk about everything. Talk about skills, interests, & project goals. Make sure that everyone's on the same page.
- Define each member's role clearly. This ensures that all job roles are covered & that boundaries are clear to everyone.

### Storming
Increased order of communication, but don't feel any sense of team fondness. The leader's word will not be followed. Personalities clash, members disagree, & is a generally bad time.

Some teams try to avoid this stage by, well, avoiding it. This is bad, though! This only encourages the problem(s) to grow until they become explosive!

#### Tips for sustainability in Storming
- Again, communication is key! Hold a meeting, talk it out maturely.
- Mediation is typically a good strategy as well. (this can be internal or external!!)
- Keep your eyes on the prize. Don't let your team kill itself over trivial matters.

### Norming
Team spirit is established! Teammates recognise other teammates' strengths & are able to work together relatively well. This is not to say there are no conflicts in this stage at all. People clash. They just get better at getting over the clashes.

#### Tips for sustainability in Norming
- Show appreciation for your teammates! This sparks motivation & encourages closer relationships to form.
- Again, keep your eyes on the prize. Remind your teammates of the importance of the project.
- Use past successes to motivate your teammates into continually moving forward,

### Performing
Teammates work in an open, trusting atmosphere with high productivity, like a well-oiled machine! Everyone is motivated & confident about their skills & value to the team. This is the era of Highest Productivity, the era that all teams strive to attain.

Do note that some teams never make it this far. Some teams get caught up in the storming stage & find themselves unable to overcome their conflicts.

#### Tips for sustainability in Performing
- Delegation is super impt!
- Indirect management is the way to go!

### Adjourning
Assessment + recognition of teammates' contributions. Then, the group disbands. üòï


## Common Values found in Successful Teams
1. **Psychological Safety**- a trust to share honest opinions.
1. **Dependability**- a trust that teammates will get what needs to be done, done.
1. **Structure & Clarity**- having clear roles & goals.
1. **Meaning**- team members sincerely enjoy what they are working on.
1. **Impact**- team members believe that they are working to creating a positive change in the world.


## How Conflict Arises in Group Development
- Unhealthy competition between teammates.
- Misunderstanding of job roles or requirements.
- Interdependence i.e. one teammate relies on another to get their work done.
- A subpar feedback system lacking frequent & genuine feedback.
- Disagreements in strategy or execution.
- Lack of focus on the goals that really matter.
- Poor delegation.
- Unproductive culture. e.g. a culture where teammates are accustomed to simply pushing the blame of missing a deadline to another teammate.


## Conflict Resolution Styles
As people have differing personalities, it thus follows that people have different ways of handling conflict. Here's a widely accepted generalisation of that concept. For a quick overview of the different conflict resolution styles, check out the diagram below.

![Conflict Resolution Styles, Charted](https://i.imgur.com/o8QQtve.png)

### Competing
These people prioritise, well, winning. They're highly assertive & uncooperative. It's very typically characteristic of these people to be largely goal-oriented, without placing much priority on relationships.

Their assertiveness can, at times, cross the border into aggressiveness & are often perceived as being intimidating. Their need to win means that there is typically someone on the corresponding losing end.

**+ / -** This conflict resolution style is good when the person's decision is, in fact, the best decision. However, this conflict resolution style commonly breeds hostility & resentment.

### Collaborating
These people aim to look for a win-win situation in everything. They're highly assertive, but also highly cooperative. This style shows a value for goals as well as relationships.

**+ / -** This conflict resolution is great because at the end of the day everyone gets what they want & theres no hostility. The only downside is that this method takes a lot of time & effort.

### Compromising
Not dissimilar to the collaborative conflict resolution style, people that take to compromise in conflict resolution are very moderate. They're moderately assertive, & moderately cooperative.

Like the collaborative conflict resolution style, these people value goals & relationships. However, the way that collaborative resolvers are steadfast in trying to find the best possible solution, these resolvers are willing to give up on some of their own values if that means that others are also willing to give up on some of their values so both parties can meet in the middle.

**+ / -** Relationships are maintained & conflicts are resolved. However, compromise can mean that the final outcome may be less than ideal. Also, this opens up avenues for manipulation.

### Avoiding
These people simply don't want to deal with conflict of any kind. They're very unassertive & uncooperative.

In the face of conflict, they give up their goals easily & remain passive to the situation. This means that they often end up in lose-lose situations.

**+ / -** No harm done to relationships, since they simply refuse to partake in conflict resolution. However, the conflicts remain unresolved & people thus tend to be perceived as pushovers.

### Accommodating
These people are ..afraid to get on people's wrong side. They are often highly cooperative to whatever view is presented to them & are very unassertive. They prioritise relationships (unlike competing resolvers!).

Put in the middle of a conflict, they are able to give up on their own goals if it means that others are able to achieve their goals. This typically manifests as a win-lose situation where the resolver is on the losing end.

**+ / -** Relationships are kept in top-notch conditions, though it leaves them in a position where they are likely to be taken advantage of.
