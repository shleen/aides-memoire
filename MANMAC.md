# A Machine
A device that does work. This work can be manifested in multiple ways-

1. **Transforms energy**- e.g. car engine
2. **Multiplies force**- e.g. hydraulic presses
3. **Multiplies speed**- e.g. bicycles
4. **Changes the direction of a force**- e.g. the pulley used in flag raising

A machine is made up of many parts, each with its own function, with the aim of performing a more significant function. A machine also, naturally, requires a power source.

- The Industrial Revolution: **1701 - 1850**
- The Steam Age: **1851 - 1940**
- The Silicon Age: **1941 - Present**


# Sources of Energy


## Muscle Power
The most archaic source of power. Refers to things like human & animal power. Machines that rely on muscle power include things like can-openers, corkscrews, levers, screwdrivers, etc.

Is... bad. People get tired! Animals get tired! Flow of energy isn't constant.


## Electric Generators
Commonly found in modern-day power stations. Generates energy that's clean & cheap. It's convenient, too! This energy powers our lives. It gets to us through giant cables that are (a) underground or (b) overhead.

Electric generators provide energy to a great many machines! Some examples are- television sets, computers, trains, etc. Unlike sources of muscle power, electric generator's can provide a constant flow of energy.

### How Generators Work- A Crash Course
A generator is basically a coil of wire contained within the field of a magnet. This coil of wire is made to spin by some external force- for example, a turbine. A turbine is spun by things like falling water or boiling water, which in turn causes the coil of wire to spin & then produce energy. 

The two types of generators- AC & DC. Design-wise, they differ in that in AC generators, the magnet rotates. Whereas it is the coil that rotates in DC generators. DC generators provide a reliable, efficient energy supply & are thus used in scale to power large motors. In contrast, AC generators more commonly power smaller motors like in home appliances such as vacuum cleaners & juicers.


## Combustion Engines
Extracts chemical energy from fuels through combustion as thermal energy, which is in turn converted to mechanical energy.

The two types of combustion engines- 1. External Combustion Engines, typically found in power stations & 2. Internal Combustion Engines (or The Four-Stroke Engine) that's found in cars & speedboats.

### The Four-Stroke Engine

Starts as fuel burns in the cylinder, causing gases to expand & thus push the piston in a cycle of 4 up & down movements. The crankshaft converts this linear motion into a rotary motion. Power! More on the four-strokes below.

1. The **Induction** (or **Suction**) Stroke
   
   The intake valve opens & lets a petrol-air mixture into the cylinder. When the piston reaches its lowest position, the valve closes.

2. The **Compression** Stroke

   The piston pushes back upwards while both valves remain closed, thus compressing the gaseous mixture in the cylinder.

3. The **Power** (or **Working**) Stroke

   The spark plug.. sparks & causes the gaseous mixture in the cylinder to explode & push the piston down. This drives the crankshaft. When the piston reaches its lowest position, the outlet valve opens.

4. The **Exhaust** Stroke

   The piston moves up in response to the outlet valve opening, thus pushing the combusted gaseous mixture out of the engine. The outlet valve closes, the intake valve opens, & the cycle repeats.


## Batteries
Provides electricity from chemical reactions. Rechargeable batteries are simply ones whose chemical reactions can be reversed. Batteries are light, clean, & safe. 

They either act as the main source of power in portable machines like stereos, hearing aids, & remote controllers, etc, or as a backup source of power in machines like computers & fax machines.


## Alternative sources
For example- Solar, Nuclear, Geothermal, Wind, Ocean power etc.

# Types of Machines
All machines in the world can be (very roughly) generalised into two types- simple & complex machines.

## Simple Machines
As it's name suggests, they perform simple functions. It's common for these machines to be quite trivial. Examples include levers, pulleys, inclined planes, & so forth.

This group of machines can be further classified into two categories- translational motion machines & rotational motion machines.

1. **Translational Motion Machines**- Machines that cause an entire body to shift from one point in space to another. For example, levers & inclined planes.

2. **Rotational Motion Machines**- Machines that cause an entire body to move around a fixed point. For example, gears & pulleys.

## Complex Machines
Complex machines are those that are made of multiple simpler, more trivial machines. These refer to machines like computers, lifts, toilets, et cetera. It's not uncommon for these machines to include a sort of feedback system. For example, toilets.

### A Feedback System (also Closed-loop System)
A feedback system is a control system, whose main function is to regulate some process' output. This regulation generally means that the output is being kept at a constant value.

Alternatively, a feedback system can serve to be a sort of gate. In these cases, a feedback system can either 1. trigger specific events to execute at specific times or 2. trigger specific events to execute when some preset conditions are met. So, a timer or an if gate.

**Advantages**
- Responds quickly to changes.
- Accurate in terms of aligning actual & desired values.

**Disadvantages**
- Complex. Many different parts that have to operate in sequence.
- Can be unstable once faulty, which is really dangerous.

#### An Example- The Toilet Tank
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/Y5Li0KX.png" width="300">

The goal- maintain a constant water level in the tank. Two main components- 1. float valve & 2. flush valve. The float valve senses the amount of water in the tank (& thus, serves to control the amount of water **entering** the tank). The flush valve controls the amount of water **leaving** the tank.

**How does it work?** The user pulls on the handle which causes the flush valve to lift, thus pushing water into the siphon pipe. As water leaves the tank, the water level decreases, & the float moves downwards. Once the float crosses a threshold, it opens up the float valve & lets water into the tank from the water inlet. Water flows into the tank until the float rises up enough to close the valve.

## Control Systems
Can be categorised into two main types- semi-automatic machines & fully-automatic machines.

### Semi-automatic Machines
These control systems require human intervention & supervision in order to operate. These are also known as human control systems.

A good example is a vehicle's steering wheel. The system is capable of accomplishing the intended task- changing the direction of the vehicle's travel. However, this is impossible without some form of human intervention, i.e. having a human driver actually turn the steering wheel.

### Fully-automatic Machines
As can be inferred, these machines are able to operate with no (or minimal) human supervision. Fully-automatic machines are thus commonly operated by computers. This derives it's alternate name, computer control systems.

<br>
It might feel intuitive to be of the opinion that fully-automatic machines are superior to semi-automatic machines. However, note that this isn't necessarily true. 

The same way that there are tasks that are difficult for humans to execute, there are similarly difficult tasks for machines to execute. For examples, the task of identifying real jewels from fake ones is difficult for a machine, in the same way it's difficult for humans to repetitively assemble machines with many small parts.

This basically means that, like most things in life, we have to find a balance. We need to know which type of control system is most suited to each situation.

## Basic Building Blocks

### Levers
A simple mechanical machine that consists of a bar that rotates (within a limit) about a fixed point. This fixed point is called a fulcrum or a pivot.
