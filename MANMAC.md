# A Machine
A device that does work. This work can be manifested in multiple ways-

1. **Transforms energy**- e.g. car engine
2. **Multiplies force**- e.g. hydraulic presses
3. **Multiplies speed**- e.g. bicycles
4. **Changes the direction of a force**- e.g. the pulley used in flag raising

A machine is made up of many parts, each with its own function, with the aim of performing a more significant function. A machine also, naturally, requires a power source.


# Sources of Energy


## Muscle Power
The most archaic source of power. Refers to things like human & animal power. Machines that rely on muscle power include things like can-openers, corkscrews, levers, screwdrivers, etc.

Is... bad. People get tired! Animals get tired! Flow of energy isn't constant.


## Electric Generators
Commonly found in modern-day power stations. Generates energy that's clean, cheap & convenient! This energy powers our lives. It gets to us through giant cables that are (a) underground or (b) overhead.

Electric generators provide energy to a great many machines! Some examples are- television sets, computers, trains, etc. Unlike sources of muscle power, electric generators can provide a constant flow of energy.

### How Generators Work- A Crash Course
A generator is basically a coil of wire contained within the field of a magnet. This coil of wire is made to spin by some external force- for example, a turbine. A turbine is spun by things like falling water or boiling water, which in turn causes the coil of wire to spin & then produce energy.

The two types of generators- AC & DC. Design-wise, they differ in that in AC generators, the magnet rotates. Whereas it is the coil that rotates in DC generators. DC generators provide a reliable, efficient energy supply & are thus used in scale to power large motors. In contrast, AC generators more commonly power smaller motors like in home appliances such as vacuum cleaners & juicers.


## Combustion Engines
Extracts chemical energy from fuels through combustion as heat, which is then converted to mechanical energy.

The two types of combustion engines- 1. External Combustion Engines, typically found in power stations & 2. Internal Combustion Engines (or The Four-Stroke Engine) that's found in cars & speedboats.

### The Four-Stroke Engine

Starts as fuel burns in the cylinder, causing gases to expand & thus push the piston in a cycle of 4 up & down movements. The crankshaft converts this linear motion into a rotary motion. Power! More on the four-strokes below.

1. The **Induction** (or **Suction**) Stroke

   The intake valve opens & lets a petrol-air mixture into the cylinder. When the piston reaches its lowest position, the valve closes.

2. The **Compression** Stroke

   The piston pushes back upwards while both valves remain closed, thus compressing the gaseous mixture in the cylinder.

3. The **Power** (or **Working**) Stroke

   The spark plug.. sparks & causes the gaseous mixture in the cylinder to explode & push the piston down. This drives the crankshaft. When the piston reaches its lowest position, the outlet valve opens.

4. The **Exhaust** Stroke

   The piston moves up in response to the outlet valve opening, thus pushing the combusted gaseous mixture out of the engine. The outlet valve closes, the intake valve opens, & the cycle repeats.


## Batteries
Provides electricity from chemical reactions. Rechargeable batteries are simply ones whose chemical reactions can be reversed. Batteries are light, clean, & safe.

They either act as the main source of power in portable machines like stereos, hearing aids, & remote controllers, etc, or as a backup source of power in machines like computers & fax machines.


## Alternative sources
For example- Solar, Nuclear, Geothermal, Wind, Ocean power etc.

# Types of Machines
All machines in the world can be (very roughly) generalised into two types- simple & complex machines.

## Simple Machines
As it's name suggests, they perform simple functions. It's common for these machines to be quite trivial. Examples include levers, pulleys, inclined planes, & so forth.

This group of machines can be further classified into two categories- translational motion machines & rotational motion machines.

1. **Translational Motion Machines**- Machines that cause an entire body to shift from one point in space to another. For example, levers & inclined planes.

2. **Rotational Motion Machines**- Machines that cause an entire body to move around a fixed point. For example, gears & pulleys.

## Complex Machines
Complex machines are those that are made of multiple simpler, more trivial machines. These refer to machines like computers, lifts, toilets, et cetera. It's not uncommon for these machines to include a sort of feedback system. For example, toilets.

### A Feedback System (also Closed-loop System)
A feedback system is a control system, whose main function is to regulate some process' output. This regulation generally means that the output is being kept at a constant value.

Alternatively, a feedback system can serve to be a sort of gate. In these cases, a feedback system can either 1. trigger specific events to execute at specific times or 2. trigger specific events to execute when some preset conditions are met. So, a timer or an if gate.

**Advantages**
- Responds quickly to changes.
- Accurate in terms of aligning actual & desired values.

**Disadvantages**
- Complex. Many different parts that have to operate in sequence.
- Can be unstable once faulty, which is really dangerous.

#### An Example- The Toilet Tank
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/Y5Li0KX.png" width="300">

The goal- maintain a constant water level in the tank. Two main components- 1. float valve & 2. flush valve. The float valve senses the amount of water in the tank (& thus, serves to control the amount of water **entering** the tank). The flush valve controls the amount of water **leaving** the tank.

**How does it work?** The user pulls on the handle which causes the flush valve to lift, thus pushing water into the siphon pipe. As water leaves the tank, the water level decreases, & the float moves downwards. Once the float crosses a threshold, it opens up the float valve & lets water into the tank from the water inlet. Water flows into the tank until the float rises up enough to close the valve.

## Control Systems
Can be categorised into two main types- semi-automatic machines & fully-automatic machines.

### Semi-automatic Machines
These control systems require human intervention & supervision in order to operate. These are also known as human control systems.

A good example is a vehicle's steering wheel. The system is capable of accomplishing the intended task- changing the direction of the vehicle's travel. However, this is impossible without some form of human intervention, i.e. having a human driver actually turn the steering wheel.

### Fully-automatic Machines
As can be inferred, these machines are able to operate with no (or minimal) human supervision. Fully-automatic machines are thus commonly operated by computers. This derives it's alternate name, computer control systems.

<br>
It might feel intuitive to be of the opinion that fully-automatic machines are superior to semi-automatic machines. However, note that this isn't necessarily true.

The same way that there are tasks that are difficult for humans to execute, there are similarly difficult tasks for machines to execute. For examples, the task of identifying real jewels from fake ones is difficult for a machine, in the same way it's difficult for humans to repetitively assemble machines with many small parts.

This basically means that, like most things in life, we have to find a balance. We need to know which type of control system is most suited to each situation.

## Basic Building Blocks

### Levers
A simple mechanical machine that consists of a bar that rotates (within a limit) about a fixed point. This fixed point is called a fulcrum or a pivot.

Some terms that will come up when talking about levers-

- **Effort**- The force applied to the lever to move a load.
- **Load**- The force that the lever is designed to overcome. This typically refers to the weight of the object that's being lifted.
- **Fulcrum** (also **Pivot**)- The point around which the lever rotates.

Like so many other things, levers can too be further grouped into three distinct categories (& one kinda category).

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/i4M9JE8.png" width="300">

Because visuals are sometimes the best way to learn.

1. **1st Class**- Fulcrum is positioned near to the load. This means that little effort is required to lift a large load. Useful in applications like crowbars & nail pullers.

2. **2nd Class**- Load is positioned in between the fulcrum & the effort. This get up will move a large load over a short distance with a small effort over a large distance. These levers can be found in bottle openers & wheelbarrows.

3. **3rd Class**- Effort is placed in between the fulcrum & the load. This converts a small movement with large effort into a large movement of a small load. For example, fishing rods!

4. **Special Levers**- For example, balancing levers that, ykno, balance 2 loads. Like in weighing scales. Also, rotating levers, where the effort is spent to spin the lever around. Like wrenches!

#### A Work Equation
    # we know that
    input = output

    # therefore
    effort * distance moved by effort = load * distance moved by load


### Pulleys
Like levers, pulleys are also simple mechanical machines. The simplest of simple pulleys consist of a wheel with a rope running over it. This wheel + rope contraption is hung as needed from its axle.

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/0hPg1bj.png" width="200">

Within the enormous family of pulleys, they can be generally split into categories for fixed or movable pulleys. This difference is quite significant, because these types of pulleys are used for different ends. Fixed pulleys are used to change the direction of a force, whereas movable pulleys are used to multiply the force exerted.

We're going to cover specific types of pulleys & look at how they provide differing mechanical advantages (MA).

1. **Single Fixed Pulleys**- Gets work done (i.e. lifting a load) by changing the direction of the effort. Work done by effort = work done by load. No mechanical advantage; **MA = 1**

2. **Single Moving Pulleys**- Halves the effort required. **MA = 2**

3. **Compound Pulleys (also Joining Pulleys)**- Multiplies effort, depending on (a) the number of pulley wheels used & (b) the number of times the rope loops over the wheels. Good mechanical advantage; **MA >= 1**

4. **Gun Tackle Pulleys**- Basically a single moving pulley with a single fixed pulley used to change the direction of the effort. Since MA of single fixed pulleys = 1, **MA remains at 2**.


Why do the seemingly alike machines produce differing MAs? `MA = load / effort` Think about it, it'll make sense.


### Wheels
Would you have guessed? Wheels are simple mechanical machines too! Circular machines that are able to transmit power continuously. It's stable thanks to **angular momentum**, & relies on centripetal forces to hold it together as it rotates.

#### + an Axle = Wheel & Axle
A simple machine used to magnify a force. For example, a car's steering wheel or a water well.

#### + a Belt = Wheel & Belts
Used to transmit motion between two bodies that are in separate points in space. Note that wheels linked in this way typically spin in the same direction.

The force & speed that the machine exerts can be manipulated by altering the difference in sizes of the wheels. These machines can be found in army tanks, that have to be able to move well in rough terrain. However, these machines tend to be on the slower side, requiring more force to be driven.


### Gears
Simple mechanical machines that are basically wheels with teeth around its circumference. Different gears differ in the size & number of their teeth. Their teeth can also vary in terms of angle inclination or build (i.e. straight or curved). Their main function is alteration of speed.

Unlike linked wheels that spin in the same direction, linked gears always spin in opposite directions.

Some things to look out for when using gears in your machines- ensure that they are aligned well & that they don't touch the ground.

We'll cover four of the more common types of gears that can be found in the great big world.

1. **Spur Gears**- What you think of when you think of gears. Are used to transfer energy between parallel shafts. e.g. car gearboxes.

2. **Rack & Pinion Gears**- A spur gear + a toothed rack (a strip of metal with teeth lining one long edge). Bridges linear & rotational movement. CON- movement is limited to the length of the toothed rack. e.g. a car's steering mechanism.

3. **Worm Gears**- A spur gear, but in the form of a screw. Typically used in conjunction with a spur gear. Note that only the shaft can spin the gear; the gear is unable to spin the worm gear. This gives a perfect application of a car's odometer.

4. **Bevel Gears**- Spur gears, but with teeth that are cut at an angle. Used to transmit motion between perpendicular shafts. e.g. a car jack.


### Motors
Electrical machines that converts **electrical energy into mechanical energy**. They get their power from electricity or assorted fuels.

Tip! You can reverse a motor simply by reversing the current that flows through the motor.

Motors are applied in oh so many places! Washing machines, refrigerators, etc!


### Generators
(also) electrical machines, that instead convert **mechanical energy to electrical energy**. Used to, ykno, generate electricity for regular use.
